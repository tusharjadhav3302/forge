# Forge Development Guidelines

## Overview

Forge is an AI-powered SDLC orchestrator that automates software development workflows using LangGraph, FastAPI, and Claude.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+ with LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- FastAPI for webhook handling
- Redis for event queuing and state checkpointing
- Anthropic Claude (via direct API or Vertex AI)
- Deep Agents for autonomous code implementation
- Podman for containerized code execution

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Linting
uv run ruff check src/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/forge/

# Start API server (dev)
uv run uvicorn forge.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start queue worker
uv run forge worker

# Build container
podman build -t forge-dev:latest containers/
```

## Code Style

- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]` (PEP 604)
- Use `StrEnum` for string enums
- Use `contextlib.suppress()` instead of empty try/except
- Prefix unused parameters with `_`
- Keep functions focused and small

## Workflow Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `forge:managed` | Ticket is managed by Forge |
| `forge:prd-pending` | Awaiting PRD approval |
| `forge:spec-pending` | Awaiting spec approval |
| `forge:plan-pending` | Awaiting epic plan approval |
| `forge:task-pending` | Awaiting task approval |
| `forge:blocked` | Workflow blocked, needs intervention |
| `forge:retry` | Trigger retry of failed step |

## Container Execution

Tasks are implemented in ephemeral Podman containers:
- System prompt loaded from `src/forge/prompts/v1/container-system.md`
- Task file written to `.forge/task.json` (excluded from commits)
- Agent has full tool access via Deep Agents
- Changes committed locally, orchestrator handles push/PR

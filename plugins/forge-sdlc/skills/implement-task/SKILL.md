# Task Implementation Skill

Implement code changes following Task specifications and project standards.

## Instructions

1. Read and understand the Task description
2. Review acceptance criteria carefully
3. Plan minimal, focused changes
4. Implement following project patterns
5. Document non-obvious decisions

## Implementation Rules

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only modify what's necessary for the Task
2. **Follow Patterns**: Match existing code style and architecture
3. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for new functionality
4. **Clean Code**: Self-documenting, well-structured code
5. **No Scope Creep**: Don't fix unrelated issues

## File Change Format

When providing code changes, format as:

```path/to/file.py
<complete file contents>
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Summary
[Brief description of changes to be made]

## Files Changed

### path/to/file1.py
[Explanation of changes]

### path/to/file2.py
[Explanation of changes]

## Implementation Notes
[Any important decisions or considerations]

## Code Changes

[File blocks with complete contents]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting implementation:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria addressed
- [ ] Tests included for new functionality
- [ ] No unrelated changes
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Error handling appropriate
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be configurable

"""Workflow state models and label-based workflow tracking.

Forge uses Jira labels (not custom statuses) to track workflow state.
This allows Forge to work with any Jira project without requiring
custom status configurations.

Label Workflow
==============

All Forge-managed issues must have the `forge:managed` label. Issues
without this label are ignored by the webhook handler.

PRD Workflow (Features):
    forge:managed      - Issue is managed by Forge
    forge:prd-drafting - PRD generation in progress
    forge:prd-pending  - PRD awaiting approval
    forge:prd-approved - PRD approved, ready for spec generation

Spec Workflow:
    forge:spec-drafting - Spec generation in progress
    forge:spec-pending  - Spec awaiting approval
    forge:spec-approved - Spec approved, ready for epic decomposition

Epic/Plan Workflow:
    forge:plan-drafting - Epic decomposition in progress
    forge:plan-pending  - Plan awaiting approval
    forge:plan-approved - Plan approved, ready for task generation

Task Workflow:
    forge:task-generated  - Tasks have been generated
    forge:implementing    - Code implementation in progress
    forge:pr-created      - Pull request created
    forge:ci-pending      - Waiting for CI/CD results
    forge:ci-failed       - CI/CD failed, attempting fix
    forge:review-pending  - Awaiting human review
    forge:review-approved - Review approved, ready to merge

Bug Workflow:
    forge:rca-drafting - Root cause analysis in progress
    forge:rca-pending  - RCA awaiting approval
    forge:rca-approved - RCA approved, ready for fix implementation

Error States:
    forge:blocked - Workflow blocked, requires manual intervention

Approval Flow
=============

To approve a generated artifact (PRD, Spec, Plan, RCA):
1. Review the attached artifact file ({ticket}-prd.md, {ticket}-spec.md, etc.)
2. Change the label from `forge:*-pending` to `forge:*-approved`
3. Forge will automatically proceed to the next workflow stage

To request revisions:
1. Add a comment with your feedback
2. Keep the `forge:*-pending` label
3. Forge will regenerate the artifact incorporating your feedback

Jira Status Mapping
===================

Forge is agnostic to Jira statuses, but recommends:
- New/Refinement: PRD and Spec drafting/approval phases
- In Progress: Implementation and CI/CD phases
- Closed: Workflow complete
